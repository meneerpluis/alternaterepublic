= PCE Goals

At the start of this government, the PCE presented a list of goals for the coalition:

[? if welfare_goal = 1 : - Expand social welfare programs - [? if welfare_goal_completed : success ?][? if not welfare_goal_completed: failed ?] ?]

[? if agriculture_goal = 1 : - Enact a land reform program. - [? if agriculture_goal_completed : success ?][? if not agriculture_goal_completed: failed ?] ?]

[? if economy_goal = 1 : - Start substantial nationalization of the economy. - [? if economy_goal_completed : success ?][? if not economy_goal_completed: failed ?] ?]

[? if finance_goal = 1 : - Make taxes more progressive. - [? if finance_goal_completed : success ?][? if not finance_goal_completed: failed ?] ?]

[? if labor_goal = 1 : - Support workers in labor disputes. - [? if labor_goal_completed : success ?][? if not labor_goal_completed: failed ?] ?]

[? if foreign_goal = 1 : - Improve our relations with the Soviet Union. - [? if foreign_goal_completed : success ?][? if not foreign_goal_completed: failed ?] ?]

[? if reichswehr_goal = 1 : - Reduce funding for the Reichswehr. - [? if reichswehr_goal_completed : success ?][? if not reichswehr_goal_completed: failed ?] ?]

Unfortunately, we have failed to accomplish all of the goals the PCE set out. They plan to call a vote of no confidence against our government, and have already begun mounting a propaganda campaign to delegitimize our government in the eyes of the workers.

- @appeal: Appeal to the Communists to have patience - we are trying!
- @PCE_vote_of_no_confidence.support_center: Could we form a new government based on the Center Party and [+ PRRS_name +] (and possibly DVP)?
- @PCE_vote_of_no_confidence.let_it_happen: Let the vote happen.
- @no_vonc: They cannot call a vote of no confidence due to the constitutional reforms, but they can obstruct our government at every opportunity.

unavailable-subtitle: [? if PCE_score < 4: They do not see us as serious in trying to achieve the goals of the coalition. ?] [? if PCE_relation < 50: Our relations are too poor. ?] [? if PCE_appeal_seen = 1: we do not have any more time. ?]

We argue that we are working hard to achieve the coalition's goals, and in the name of proletarian solidarity, we must make this coalition function. Surprisingly, the PCE hears our pleas, and is willing to give us six more months before the coalition goals must be achieved.

Against all expectations, the PCE's goals have all been met! Apparently the Communists did not prepare for this eventuality, a worker's government successfully built through democratic means. They will continue to "tolerate" our government for the rest of our term, while still acting as a watchdog against bourgeois backsliding.

We have been effectively made a minority government, and the PCE intends to obstruct our attempts to pass policy.
