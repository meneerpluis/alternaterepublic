= PCE Party Conference

Now is the PCE's national party conference, where they will choose their new leadership. The shadow of the Wittorf Affair hangs over it. On one hand are the hardline supporters of Th채lmann, who support a "social fascist" policy that places the PSOE as equivalent to the Nazis. On the other hand is the "Conciliator" faction, who support a more cooperative policy towards the PSOE.

After our discussion with the Soviets, we are inclined to believe that Stalin is at least open to the Conciliators. In order to affect the PCE's leadership elections, we have to influence both the Comintern leaders as as well as the PCE membership.

With our support, the Conciliators have won the leadership contest! The new leadership is a group of Conciliators, including Arthur Ewert, Hugo Eberlein, and Ernst Meyer. Th채lmann remains, but largely as a figurehead only, it seems. We hope that the new leadership will be more inclined towards cooperation.

Unfortunately, we could not influence the PCE leadership election against the hardliners. Th채lmann quickly moves to consolidate absolute leadership, expelling or exiling his opponents.
