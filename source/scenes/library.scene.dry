@government
go-to: menu

Spain currently is a constitutional monarchy. The lower house of parliament is composed of representatives elected by single-member constituencies leading to a few larger parties. The upper house included both elected members and senators appointed by the king and was designed to represent the aristocracy and the church. This means that Spains democracy is dominated by oligarchic and aristocratic intrests. Currently there is universal male sufferage, so women aren't allowed to vote.

Currently there is a electoral law in the works that will abolish the upper house and reform the single-member constituencies into larger multi-member constituencies. These new constituencies give bonus seats to the electoral list that achieves a majority or a plurality of the vote. Meaning that large multi-party coalitions are favored by this system.

However after the resignation of Primo de Rivera the republican forces are hoping to reform the kingdom into a truly democratic republic. If they win the upcoming election they will draft a new constitution to adopt universal female sufferage, secularize the country, give regional autonomy, abolish the monarchy and more.

Spain is divided into regions, each with its own local governments and varying degrees of autonomy. Most of these regions, like Catalonia and the Basque Country, have cultural and linguistic difference with the rest of Spain leading to strong regionalist sentiment.

= Timeline of the PSOE and Spain (until 1930)

**1873-1874**: The First Spanish Republic is proclaimed following the abdication of King Amadeo I. The republic is short-lived, marked by political instability and rebellions. It ends with the restoration of the Bourbon monarchy under King Alfonso XII.

**1876**: The Spanish Constitution of 1876 is enacted, establishing a constitutional monarchy. 

**1879**: The PSOE is founded in Madrid by Pablo Iglesias, advocating for workers' rights and socialism.

**1898**: Spain loses its remaining overseas colonies in the Spanish-American War. This defeat leads to Spanish decline on the world stage and domestically.

**1902**: King Alfonso XIII ascends the throne.

**1910**: The PSOE gains its first parliamentary seat.

**1917**: A general strike supported by the PSOE, Unions and anarchists paralyzes the country. The strike is crushed by the military.

**1921**: The Disaster of Annual occurs in Spanish Morocco, where Spanish forces suffer a catastrophic defeat at the hands of Rif rebels. The loss leads to widespread criticism of the military and the monarchy, further destabilizing the government.

**1923**: General Miguel Primo de Rivera stages a coup with the support of King Alfonso XIII, establishing a military dictatorship.

**1929**: Economic decline leads to growing opposition against the dictatorial rule of Primo de Rivera. 

**1930**: Primo de Rivera resigns, and the monarchy attempts to restore constitutional rule. The PSOE joins republican and regionalist forces in calling for the end of the monarchy.
