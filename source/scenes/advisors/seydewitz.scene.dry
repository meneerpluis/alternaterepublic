@class_struggle
title: Rally for class struggle
subtitle: The core of socialism should be the struggle of the proletariat against the bourgeoisie.
unavailable-subtitle: [? if advisor_action_timer > 0 : [+ advisor_action_timer +] months before next advisor action. ?]
choose-if: advisor_action_timer = 0
on-arrival: advisor_action_timer = 6; workers_PSOE += 4*(1-dissent); unemployed_PSOE += 3*(1-dissent); workers_PSOE += 4*(1-dissent) if nationalization_progress > 0; unemployed_PSOE += 3*(1-dissent) if nationalization_progress > 0; left_strength += 5; left_dissent -= 5; old_middle_PSOE -= 3; new_middle_PSOE -= 2

Our message of class struggle appeals to the left wing of the working class, while potentially alienating the middle class. [? if nationalization_progress > 0 : Our achievements in nationalization have assisted our messaging. ?]


@socialist_youth
title: Support the Socialist Youth
subtitle: We must end our reputation as a party for old men by increasing funding to the youth organizations. -1 resources
unavailable-subtitle: [? if advisor_action_timer > 0 : [+ advisor_action_timer +] months before next advisor action. ?] [? if resources <= 0 : Not enough resources. ?]
choose-if: advisor_action_timer = 0 and resources > 0
on-arrival: advisor_action_timer = 6; resources -= 1; left_strength += 5; left_dissent -= 3; rb_strength += 50; rb_militancy += 0.025; workers_PSOE += 2*(1-dissent); new_middle_PSOE += 1;

Seydewitz supports building up the Socialist Youth, which attracts support to the Left and increases the militancy of the Socialist Militants.

@against_toleration
title: Against toleration
subtitle: Break our current toleration arrangement, and bring down the government via a no-confidence vote.
unavailable-subtitle: [? if advisor_action_timer > 0 : [+ advisor_action_timer +] months before next advisor action. ?] [? if PSOE_toleration == 0 : The PSOE is not currently in toleration. ?]
view-if: not constructive_vonc
choose-if: advisor_action_timer == 0 and PSOE_toleration
on-arrival: advisor_action_timer = 6; next_election_time = time + 3 if next_election_time > time+3; next_election_month = month + 3 if next_election_time >= time + 3; next_election_year = year if next_election_time >= time + 3; next_election_year += 1 if next_election_month > 12; next_election_month -= 12 if next_election_month > 12; PSOE_toleration = 0; left_strength += 8; pro_republic -= 4; new_middle_PSOE -= 3; rural_PSOE -= 3; old_middle_PSOE -= 3; catholics_PSOE -= 3; reformist_dissent += 8

We have grown tired of the burdens of toleration, and have called a vote of no confidence in the current minority government.

New elections have been set for [+ next_election_month : month +] [+ next_election_year +].
